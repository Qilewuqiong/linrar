----- Building -----
These tools are built using GNU autotools. You will need to use autotools to
generate the configure script and the configure script to generate the
makefiles for your environment.

To generate the configure script: 
autoconf -if

To generate the makefiles:
./configure --prefix=<install path>

To make and install the binaries:
make install

Each monitor includes a usage string. All three monitors are wrappers around some other process that will be executing on the node and include logic so that only one monitor is run per node.
